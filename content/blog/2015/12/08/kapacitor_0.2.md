Kapacitor version 0.2.0 has been released today.
This release is a bug fix release since the initial release last week.
We want to commit to making regular updates to Kapacitor, so we are going to follow a regular release cadance.
If a feature is ready when the next release comes around it will be included, if not it will have to wait for a later release.
Iteratively we will be able to fix bugs and push out quality features.
Our initial plans are to cut a release every month.
Time will tell if this is the right cadance for Kapacitor or if we should adjust.

We have received great feedback from the community in the past several days since the initial release.
We are constructing a roadmap based on that feedback for the next several months of feature development for Kapacitor.
The next big feature to hit Kapacitor will be custom user functions.
This will enable you to plugin in your own custom algorithms for running anomaly detection or ETL jobs, etc.
Since integrating your custom code to another software stack can be tedious and difficult process, we are making ease of use a priority for this feature.
We want to get it right so that it meets your needs while not being a difficult and cumbersome task.
One of our big questions for the community is what languages would you like supported for integrating your algorithms with Kapacitor?
Let us know on the github issue [here](https://github.com/influxdb/kapacitor/issues/72).
Or if you have specific ideas on how you would like to see this feature work please chime in as well.

That's it for now. Kapacitor's next release will be in January.
